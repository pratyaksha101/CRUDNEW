# CRUDNEW
This CRUD application involves four basic operations on a database that are Create, Read, Update and Delete respective details. It is a Full stack Project and Responsive in nature.
I have used MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js to build this Project. For styling my Project I have used Bootstrap (CSS Framework).
The user of this Website can add their details in the Database by filling the Registration Form(Create) by clicking +Add Data button.
User can Edit their details by clicking the Edit-Icon.
User can Delete their details from DB by clicking the Delete -Icon.
